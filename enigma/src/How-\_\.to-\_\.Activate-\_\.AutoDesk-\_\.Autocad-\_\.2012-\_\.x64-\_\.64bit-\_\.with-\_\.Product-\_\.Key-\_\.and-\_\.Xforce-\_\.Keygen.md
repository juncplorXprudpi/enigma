## Fast, Flexible Coding
 
One of the main advantages of Dreamweaver is its smart, simplified coding engine that helps you write and edit code faster and easier. You can access code hints to quickly learn and edit HTML, CSS, and other web standards. You can also use visual aids to reduce errors and speed up site development. For example, you can use the Live View mode to preview your changes in real time without switching to a separate browser window. You can also edit text and image properties directly in Live View with one click[^1^].
 
## Set Up to Site Up in Fewer Steps
 
Dreamweaver also makes it easy to get your sites up and running with starter templates that you can customize to build HTML emails, About pages, blogs, ecommerce pages, newsletters, and portfolios[^1^]. You can choose from a variety of layouts and themes that suit your needs and preferences. You can also import assets from your Creative Cloud Libraries and Adobe Stock to enhance your sites with images, fonts, colors, and more[^1^].
 
## Collaborate with Git Support
 
If you work with a team or on multiple devices, you can use Dreamweaver's Git support to manage your source code and collaborate with others. You can perform all common Git operations right from the Git panel in Dreamweaver. You can also sync your local and remote repositories, compare files and branches, merge changes, and resolve conflicts[^1^].
 
## Stay Updated with New Features
 
Dreamweaver CC Pro 2020 is constantly updated with new features and enhancements to improve your web design experience. Some of the recent additions include multi-monitor support for Windows[^1^], new default settings for Japanese fonts[^2^], improved code-hinting popups[^2^], security upgrades[^3^], and bug fixes[^3^].
